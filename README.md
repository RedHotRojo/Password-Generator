# Password-Generator
Generate potential passwords using Python and concatenate common passwords other people have made like fasttrack.txt, rockyou.txt.gz, and nmap.lst

Initially created to crack handshakes with Kali Linux

It's not very biased; it just creates a password from random characters.
- You can type a character list to generate the password or use the pre-written list

Use the pre-written character list guide as how you SHOULDN'T create your passwords
- Use random characters you rarely use and random sequences for a good password.
